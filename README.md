# libsetcolor is a simple library!

its simple, so simple, all i need to tell you is...

the supported colors are:

black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white

text is for the text color, bg is for the background color

use bright and normal respectively for color variations

I made macro definitions for color and colour
so you can do setcolour and resetcolours instead if you want

and to read the example.c

# congrats!

you now use libsetcolor!
